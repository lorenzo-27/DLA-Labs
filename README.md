# Deep Learning Applications
This repository contains three Deep Learning Projects:
1. **L1_CNNs**: contains an implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for image classification tasks, with support for both standard and residual architectures. Additionally, a sub-project integrates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to visualize the critical regions influencing CNN-based classification decisions.
2. **L2_DRL**:
   - **cartpole**: contains an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) for solving the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gymnasium.
   - **car_racing**: contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for solving the CarRacing-v3 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium.
3. **L3_Transformers**: contains implementations of different approaches for fine-tuning transformer models on sentiment analysis tasks, focusing on efficient parameter training techniques including LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), freezing strategies, and adapter modules.
